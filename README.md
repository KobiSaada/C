Simple Math app
Build Status

SimpleMath is an app that generates simple math equations for young children to help them solve and learn in a fun way. I've made this app for my 6 year old daughter because I don't have to write or print the equations and I don't need to evaluate them as well, the app does it all. I am very happy I can make my daughter's learning process easier, but this project has also given me a great "toy" to play around and learn / practice SwiftUI & Combine. It is heavily inspired by Paul Hudson's recent SwiftUI Live video, I highly recommend it.

Features
 Generate addition, subtraction, multiplication and division equations.
 Record results and provide visual and audio feedback.
 Show progress of completed equations as well as correct answers.
 Display results after a completed session with corrections on wrong answers.
 An option to start a new session after finishing.
 Display a simple cheerful animation if all equations are solved correctly.
 Settings UI that allows customization of:
 Operand digit input range.
 Number of generated equations (minimum 5, maximum 30).
 Enable / disable equation types: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
 Toggle sounds.
 Scaling fonts and UI for all supported iOS13+ devices.

Todo
 Add light / dark mode support.
 Customize colors / themes (it is very purple now, my target audience demanded it!).
 Support landscape layout.
 Adaptive sessions, use wrong answers from previous sessions, repetition is key!
 More gamification, with sounds and visual effects, simple achievement system.
 Helpful hints when tapping on current equation.
 Flexible equation layout, ex 1 + _ = 3.
 Whatever my target audience demands!
